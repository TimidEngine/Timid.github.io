          <p>Once ENIAC's construction was finished, the engineers realized they didn't have any idea how to program it. As a solution, they chose six of the "computers" to program the machine. These women were Jean Bartik, Betty Holberton, Kathleen Antonelli, Marlyn Meltzer, Frances Spence, and Ruth Teitelbaum. These remarkable women developed the ENIAC “software” before software existed!</p>

          <h1 class="subtitle">The Interface</h1>
          
          <p>Programming was conducted using an interface consisting of 3,000 switches and a tricky wiring layout. The wiring interface was similar to a plugboard however it was more of an interface built into ENIAC. This interface literally changed the wiring of the machine. But before the programmers could input “commands”, they wrote down what they were going to program on paper. This included varieties of flow-charts and tables for reprogramming.</p>

          <h1 class="subtitle">The Challenges</h1>
          
          <p>One of the major difficulties of programming ENIAC was that it was a parallel machine. This meant that the computer did multiple operations at one time. In today's technologically sophisticated world we may call this multi-threading. The programmers had to time events so they finished at the right time. Another problem the programmers faced was that there was no existing code or even a way to write code. The women had to figure out how a computer starts, is structured, and how each system interacts with each other.</p>

          <p>Furthermore, when the programmers were originally told to program ENIAC, they weren't given the clearance to access the machine. Instead, they used wiring diagrams to dissect the computer. The programmers used each of the panel for a different purpose. One panel was used for square roots and division. About 20 were accumulator sections (addition and subtraction), and others were tasked with instructing other panel.</p>

          <h1 class="subtitle">The Accomplishments</h1>
          <p>Although there were many achievements, the programmers achieved something that is still considered impressive today! They fixed a hardware flaw using a software: More specifically, the women managed to isolate vacuum tube breakage to a specific panel using software. This saves time and resources as the computer couldn't operate properly until these are removed.</p>
