      <h1 class="page-title">ENIAC</h1><hr><div class="segment"><div class="vertical"><h1 class="subtitle">The Problem</h1><p>During World War II, the U.S. Army had a problem. It couldn't hit distanced targets with missiles. As it turns out, there is a differential equation that can be used to calculate where a missile will land-based on certain conditions such as the weather. Tables somehow needed to be made so that anyone who was aiming could determine where to aim. This daunting task was put off to be solved by the Ballistic Research Laboratory (BRL). They resolved a temporary solution of assembling a team of "computers" to manually calculate tables. Eventually, ENIAC would become the permanent solution to this problem.</p></div><img src="images/missile.jpg" width="30%"></div><hr><div class="segment" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><img src="images/artillery_table.jpg" width="25%"><div class="vertical"><h1 class="subtitle">The Women</h1><p>Women with degrees in mathematics were asked in the assistance of calculating these firing tables. To compute these values the women would use already existing mechanical devices, usually adding machines. At this point in history, there are about 100 women working at creating these tables. On average, they took approximately 40 hours to finish one table so the women did about one per week.</p></div></div><div class="segment"><video src="video/marlyn_meltzer.mp4" width="600" height="350" controls controlsList="nodownload"></video></div><hr><div class="segment" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><div class="vertical"><h1 class="subtitle">The Scheme</h1><p>Enter ENIAC, John Mauchly had hypothesized a machine that would use vacuum tubes to evaluate mathematical computations. ENIAC was similar to previous machines but with a slight twist. It would use a fully electronic design instead of the previous electromechanical to increase speed 1000-fold. ENIAC is estimated to have taken about 200,000 man-hours to construct and housed about 18,000 vacuum tubes, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors, 6,000 switches, and 1,500 relays. All of these connections were made manually whereas today another machine would create the computer. The giant weighed roughly 30 tons (60,000 lbs), and cost over $400,000.</p></div><img src="images/overview.jpg" width="30%"></div><div class="segment" style="margin-top:0;"><p>ENIAC used a paneling system which consisted of 40 original cabinets along with two IBM machines for input and output. Each panel was eight feet tall and two feet wide. The panels occupied three of the walls of the Moore School basement. The basement was remarkably 50 feet long!</p></div><hr><a class="page-btn" href="programmers.html">Programmers</a>
