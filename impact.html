          <h1 class="subtitle">Recognition</h1>
          <p>For a long time, the programmers were given next to no recognition. It was the sleuthing of Kathy Kleiman that discovered much of the programmers' forgotten story. Kathy was a student at Harvard when she noticed that as she moved up in the difficulties of computer science courses, there were fewer and fewer women. She inquired: Do women belong in computing? Searching for women in computing, she found a picture these women standing in front of the ENIAC. After digging profusely, Her research with the University of Pennsylvania led her to the 40th anniversary of ENIAC. At the celebration, she found a group of women who were talking about the ENIAC. They were talking about very technical parts of ENIAC. She realized that these were the women from the pictures. Nearly ten years later when she realized ENIAC’s 50th Anniversary was coming up, she asked which programmers would be coming to the celebration, the Dean didn’t know who they were. She tracked them down again and decided to film them. After falling down a few more rabbit holes, Kathy nominated them for awards.</p>

          <p>The women were honored to have received these awards after all of this time. Betty Holberton received the Ada Lovelace Award and IEEE Computer Pioneer Award, 1997. Jean Bartik received the IEEE Computer Pioneer Award in 2009 and the Computer History Museum Fellow Award in 2008. They also all received awards from the Women In Technology International Hall of Fame Awards in 1997 as well.</p>

          <h1 class="subtitle">Barriers</h1>
          <p>ENIAC achieved the impossible. After 200,000 hours of labor and over two and a half years, ENIAC accomplished what it set out to do: Create a fully electronic computer. Instead of having to have parts such as motors churning to store analog data, ENIAC could have both code and constants stored digitally. This breakthrough has been shown to be quintessential to modern technology and is the reason ENIAC was more than 1000 times faster than any of its predecessors. Today we have the typical I.T. stereotype: A quiet guy who doesn't like to talk to anyone. In reality, computing is much larger than that. These Women broke barriers in stereotypes before they even existed.</p>
