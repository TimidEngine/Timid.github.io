        <p>My History Day topic was the ENIAC Programmers. I chose the ENIAC Programmers because I have a fascination with computers. While preparing for this project, I had the idea to research early computers. After stumbling upon the ENIAC, I thought this topic was exactly was I was looking for. However, I later discovered the ENIAC programmers further extending the connection to the them. During World War II, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), along with its programmers, broke countless barriers in the computer industry, laying the framework for all modern technology.</p>
        <p>To begin my research, I started learning basic information about ENIAC and early computing. Wanting to find something that was relevant to modern society, I stumbled upon the ENIAC Programmers Project. I saw what the project was about and decided to contact the founder, Kathy Kleiman. She had remarkable stories of the programmers and has been the best source of information to me. She explained in further detail. Some primary sources I used were Interviews with the ENIAC Programmers. These extend my learning because they express the opinions and thoughts of the programmers directly. For my project, I also conducted advanced research. To help me with advanced research steps, I wrote several letters to ask for information.  I received four back as a result of my letters. Since I was newer to the field of advanced research, I also conducted a research visit to the Marathon County Public Library Wausau Branch. They helped to teach me more about advanced research and gave me more resources. I organized my information in notes about ENIAC, Programmers, and relation to the theme. This showed to be very useful because I could read through them later and know what note is relevant to what page.</p>
        <p>Once I finished my research, I needed to put the project together. I decided that a website would fit the ENIAC the best because both are related heavily to technology. I chose to use a grayish color palette because pictures couldn’t capture color at the time so it matched the aesthetic. Computers were also gray at the time so it fit well (Decision of Betty Holberton). I decided to implement my website using programming. Programming in HTML and CSS future-proofed my project because the NHD Web Central Editor supports custom code. The best part of the project was talking with Kathy Kleiman because she has been a major contributor to the recognition of the programmers and is quite delightful to talk with.</p>
        <p>Through the process of completing this project, I learned about conducting advanced research and putting a strong project together. My topic relates to this year’s History Day theme of Breaking Barriers in History because both the computers and the programmers broke barriers. The computer achieved something that had never been done and the women broke barriers for women. ENIAC’s programmers enabled modern computers by breaking barriers in programming and computing.</p>
